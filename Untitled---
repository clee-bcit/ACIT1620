what is the target of a src-or-href?
    either a URL (if it starts with a scheme, like "http://")
    or else a "url reference"

    <a> tag defines a hyperlink
    <a> element in href attribute

there are two kinds of url references
    * absolute
    * relative

    absolute - full URL to a file
    ex) <img src="http://www.google.com/images/pictures.jpg">
    relative - points to a file relatice to the current page


how do I tell the difference between absolute and relative url references?
    http:// vs desktop/folder/folder/




suppose I give a src-or-href this value: "/week4/personal_website/CSS/styles.css"
    a) is that absolute or relatie?
        relative
    b) my browser needs to turn that into a complete URL.  what URL will it do?
        http://127.0.0.1:8887/personal_website/

    c) why is this fucked?

    delete '/' 


what complete URL would work out okay?

okay.  what url-reference can I write that makes that work?
